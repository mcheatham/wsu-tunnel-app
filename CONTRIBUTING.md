# Contributing Guidelines

## General
Keep it clean. 'Nuff said.

## Code Format
Code should be pretty. If code is not pretty, it will be prettified.

## Branches

### Master Branch
Any pull requests to the master branch require two reviewers, ideally these should
  be Ryan L. and whoever is in charge of the branch being merged.

### All Other Branches
For now, all other branches are open to anyone on the project team.

### Deleting Branches
_**Don't**_ (unless you have permission of every one on the team)

Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything.")
